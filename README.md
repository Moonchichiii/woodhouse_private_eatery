## Project Goals

  

This restaurant site is designed for efficiency, enabling users to register username and password. Once registered, they can book, edit, or delete their reservations.

  

Additionally incorporated a functionality for staff, to have the capability to create reservations for guests and also manage them by editing or deleting them

if needed. Handle a menu change to site on the same page, and login at the same login as guests,will be redirected to management page instead, when logged in as staff.

  

In terms of design, a minimalist website that's simple to navigate, and use of contrast in mind, also responsive so easily accessible across various devices.

### External Userâ€™s Goal


Looking for an intuitive and accessible booking experience, without to many options keeping it simple,  

Easy Booking dashboard Enables guests to conveniently make online reservations for their preferred number of guests, on  

flexible scheduling offers guests the flexibility to choose their preferred booking date and time slot, adding convenience to their planning. 

instant confirmation provides to reassure customers about their reservation details.

---

## User Stories
 

As a guest, upon first arrival, I can easily register using a simple sign-up form based on a username and password I choose.

 

Once logged in, my booking_id is linked to my created user account. After registration, i'm redirected to the booking dashboard where all

my bookings are displayed. Here, I can quickly edit or cancel any of my bookings.

  

I can still navigate around the entire site as a return button appears in place of the signup/login button,

allowing me to easily navigate back to the booking dashboard.

  

- Making a Reservation

  

If I have an existing booking, it's displayed as soon as I log in to the dashboard. If there are no bookings linked to my account, I can create a new reservation. The dashboard gives me the flexibility to edit or cancel any reservation, letting me adjust my plans as needed.



The logout option is conveniently located on the dashboard and returns me to the starting point of the website.

  
  

- As management

  

As a staff member, I log in with predefined credentials and am redirected to the admin panel. I need to effectively manage guests' reservations, including the ability to create, edit, or cancel bookings, and update the menu and prices.

## Building out the Backend

I employed namespacing to maintain a clean project structure, free from cluttered files, this approach will keep the file organization clean. 

`from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [

path("author-polls/", include("polls.urls", namespace="author-polls")),

path("bookings/", include("polls.urls", namespace="bookings")),

]`

- This project urls layout 

urlpatterns = [

    path('', include('frontend.urls', namespace='frontend')), 
    path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls', namespace='accounts')), 
    path('bookings/', include('bookings.urls', namespace='bookings')), 
    path('menu/', include('menu.urls', namespace='menu')), 
]
 

***Backend:*** This is the project folder / base.
  
App - ***Frontend:*** The base of the frontend templates, including index.html / base.html.
  
App ***Accounts:*** To gain access to the private eatery, sign up & and login to book your table.

App ***Bookings:*** Handles the booking side of the project.

App ***Menu:*** For managers of the site to easily change the menu and prices on the site.  

For the forms, I will use Bootstrap's form tags where I can, for ease of use. Also, going with Bootstrap CDN to make the site responsive and provide out-of-the-box layouts.
  

For security reasons i concealed the `SECRET_KEY`, which have been changed during the development, and also all other `API_KEYS` and updated it since the project's inception. I also revised my `settings.py` to prepare it for future deployment on Heroku.  

**Discovering `.env` and Implementation:** I discovered the utility of using `.env` with `decouple` for streamlined management in `settings.py`. This approach allowed for shorter, more manageable lines in the configuration file.
