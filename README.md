## Project Goals

  
This restaurant project is designed to for enabling users to simply register a username and choose a password. Once registered, they can book, edit, or delete their reservations.

  
Additionally, I incorporated a functionality for staff to allow them to create reservations for guests, edit or delete them

, handle a menu change on the same page, login using the same login as the guests, redirecting to the management page, loggin them as staff directly.

  

In terms of design, it is a minimalist website that is simple to navigate, with use of contrast in mind, and responsive so easily accessible across various devices.


---

  

### External Userâ€™s Goal


Looking for an intuitive and accessible booking experience, without too many options, keeping it simple.  

A simple booking dashboard enables guests to conveniently make online reservations for their preferred number of guests.   

A flexible scheduling offers guests the flexibility to choose their preferred booking date and time slot, adding convenience to their planning. 

An instant confirmation is displayed on the screen to reassure customers about their reservation details.

---

## User Stories
 

On the landing page, users can easily register using a simple sign-up form based on a username and password they choose.

 

Once logged in, their booking_id is linked to the user account they created. After registering, they are redirected to the booking dashboard where all

their bookings are displayed. From there, they can easily edit or cancel any of their bookings.

  

Users can still navigate the entire site as a return button appears instead of the signup/login button,

allowing them to easily navigate back to the booking dashboard.

  

- Making a Reservation

  

If a user has an existing booking, it will be displayed as soon as the user logs in to the dashboard. If there are no bookings linked to the account, they can create a new reservation. The dashboard gives the flexibility to edit or cancel any reservation, letting the users adjust their plans as needed.



The logout option is conveniently located on the dashboard and redirects users to the starting point of the website.

  
  

- As Management

  

Staff members log in with predefined credentials and are redirected to the admin page. Staff have the abibility to manage guests'reservations, create, edit, or cancel bookings, and update the menu and prices.

## Building out the Backend

- After install the django version you want to use, start of with the command `django-admin startproject backend .` In my case, then follow up with the apps if you know from the start 
python manage.py startapp `accounts`, `bookings`, `frontend`, `menu`

***Backend:*** This is the project folder / base.
  
App - ***Frontend:*** The base of the frontend templates, including index.html / base.html.
  
App ***Accounts:*** To gain access to the private eatery, sign up & and login to book your table.

App ***Bookings:*** Handles the booking side of the project.

App ***Menu:*** For managers of the site to easily change the menu and prices on the site.  


For security reasons I concealed the `SECRET_KEY`, which have been changed during the development, and also all other `API_KEYS` and updated it since the project's inception. I also revised my `settings.py` to prepare it for future deployment on Heroku.  

**Discovering `.env` and Implementation:** I discovered the utility of using `.env` with `decouple` for streamlined management in `settings.py`. This approach allowed for shorter, more manageable lines in the configuration file.

-  `python-decouple==3.8`: Separates settings parameters from code, making configuration more secure and scalable.

I employed namespacing to maintain a clean project structure, free from cluttered files, this approach will keep the file organization clean. 

`from django.urls import include, path

`from django.urls import include, path` 

- This project urls layout in the backend's urls.py 

urlpatterns = [

    path('', include('frontend.urls', namespace='frontend')), 
    path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls', namespace='accounts')), 
    path('bookings/', include('bookings.urls', namespace='bookings')), 
    path('menu/', include('menu.urls', namespace='menu')), 
]

## Hosting Static Assets: Cloudinary

- https://cloudinary.com  

- Cloudinary hosts static assets like stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and videos, optimizing media file management and performance.

## Deployment
 

- Set up the settings.py before pushing it to Heroku, don't forget Debbug = `False` 

- Push it to the main on github, then follow the steps below.


- https://www.heroku.com

  - Heroku provides a platform for easy deployment and scaling of the application.

  - Create your app and select your region. 


-  **Steps for Deployment:**


***Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository***

   ***Don't forget to add your config vars to Heroku***

   <img src="/readmecontent/images/configvars.png" alt="Image 15" width="250"/>
   
   
   - Heroku, including `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1`. when your using Cloudinary

   - Use the Heroku CLI to push it from your ide, or simply go to the website and connect your repositorie, and deploy directly from the site.

   - If you are on the site and have set your Config Vars, then go to the "Deploy tab" and scroll down to "DEPLOY BRANCH"
   
   - View the build log for errors if any comes up.
